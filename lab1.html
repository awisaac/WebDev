					<p class="pBlog">Today it felt like it was going to rain, so of course I needed to listen to Feels Like Rain while enjoying a Flying Dog Brewery's Snake Dog. With a 7.1% ABV and a clear medium straw colored body, this beer is well balanced with a delayed bitterness. The citrus aroma makes this IPA a unique and tasty choice to pair with roasted chicken.</p>

					<p class="pBlog">No one was here when I got home, but I had just picked up a six pack of Indica from Lost Coast Brewery, so of course I needed to listen to I Drink Alone by George Thoroughgood and the Destroyers. With its 6.5% ABV and an appetizing honey and grapefruit aroma, this crisp IPA has a pleasant malty backbone.</p>

					<p class="pBlog">When I was teenager, my dad and I would often take highway 395 to the Sierra Nevadas for overnight backpacking trips. We would listen to Cale and Clapton's Road to Escondido on the way. So when this IPA from Mammoth Brewing Company caught my eye in the store, I knew exactly which album to go with it.  With a juniper and pine aroma, I was instantly brought back to memories of hiking in on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevadas. With a malty, but not too sweet, taste and a sharp finish, I can definitely say that I like this beer.</p>
